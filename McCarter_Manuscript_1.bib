In these pathways, a sensor kinase, when activated by a signal, phosphorylates its own histidine, which then serves as a phosphoryl donor to an aspartate in a response regulator protein. The Sln1 protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has sequence similarities to both the histidine kinase and the response regulator proteins of bacteria. A missense mutation in SLN1 is lethal in the absence but not in the presence of the N-end rule pathway, a ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system. The finding of SLN1 demonstrates that a mode of signal transduction similar to the bacterial two-component design operates in eukaryotes as well.},

The effect on AP-1 transcriptional activity results, in part, from enhanced phosphorylation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal activation domain. Here, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of JNK1, a distant relative of the MAP kinase group that is activated by dual phosphorylation at Thr and Tyr during the UV response. Significantly, Ha-Ras partially activates JNK1 and potentiates the activation caused by UV. JNK1 binds to the c-Jun transactivation domain and phosphorylates it on Ser-63 and Ser-73. Thus, JNK1 is a component of a novel signal transduction pathway that is activated by oncoproteins and UV irradiation. These properties indicate that JNK1 activation may play an important role in tumor promotion.},

abstract = {Previous work on the responses of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade components in a Xenopus oocyte extract system demonstrated that p42 MAP kinase (MAPK) exhibits a sharp, sigmoidal stimulus/response curve, rather than a more typical hyperbolic curve. One plausible explanation for this behavior requires the assumption that MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK) carries out its dual phosphorylation of p42 MAPK by a distributive mechanism, where MAPKK dissociates from MAPK between the first and second phosphorylations, rather than a processive mechanism, where MAPKK carries out both phosphorylations before dissociating. Here we have investigated the mechanism through which a constitutively active form of human MAPKK-1 (denoted MAPKK-1 R4F or MAPKK-1*) phosphorylates Xenopus p42 MAPK in vitro. We found that the amount of monophosphorylated MAPK formed during the phosphorylation reaction exceeded the amount of MAPKK-1* present, which would not be possible if the phosphorylation occurred exclusively by a processive mechanism. The monophosphorylated MAPK was phosphorylated predominantly on tyrosine, but a small proportion was phosphorylated on threonine, indicating that the first phosphorylation is usually, but not invariably, the tyrosine phosphorylation. We also found that the rate at which pulse-labeled monophosphorylated MAPK became bisphosphorylated depended on the MAPKK-1* concentration, behavior that is predicted by the distributive model but incompatible with the processive model. These findings indicate that MAPKK-1* phosphorylates p42 MAPK by a two-collision, distributive mechanism rather than a single-collision, processive mechanism, and provide a mechanistic basis for understanding how MAP kinase can convert graded inputs into switch-like outputs.},

abstract = {Protein phosphatases inactivate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways by dephosphorylating components of the MAPK cascade. Two genes encoding protein-tyrosine phosphatases, PTP2, and a new phosphatase, PTP3, have been isolated in a genetic selection for negative regulators of an osmotic stress response pathway called HOG, for high osmolarity glycerol, in budding yeast. PTP2 and PTP3 were isolated as multicopy suppressors of a severe growth defect due to hyperactivation of the HOG pathway. Phosphatase activity is required for suppression since mutation of the catalytic Cys residue in Ptp2 and Ptp3, destroys suppressor function and biochemical activity. The substrate of these phosphatases is likely to be the MAPK, Hog1. Catalytically inactive Ptp2 and Ptp3 coprecipitate with Hog1 from yeast extracts. In addition, strains lacking PTP2 and PTP3 do not dephosphorylate Hog1-phosphotyrosine as well as wild type. The latter suggests that PTP2 and PTP3 play a role in adaptation. Consistent with this role, osmotic stress induces expression of PTP2 and PTP3 transcripts in a Hog1-dependent manner. Thus Ptp2 and Ptp3 likely act in a negative feedback loop to inactivate Hog1.},

abstract = {In response to increases in extracellular osmolarity, Saccharomyces cerevisiae activates the HOG1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which is composed of a pair of redundant MAPK kinase kinases, namely, Ssk2p and Ssk22p, the MAPK kinase Pbs2p, and the MAPK Hog1p. Hog1p is activated by Pbs2p through phosphorylation of specific threonine and tyrosine residues. Activated Hog1p is essential for survival of yeast cells at high osmolarity. However, expression of constitutively active mutant kinases, such as those encoded by SSK2deltaN and PBS2(DD), is toxic and results in a lethal level of Hog1p activation. Overexpression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase Ptp2p suppresses the lethality of these mutations by dephosphorylating Hog1p. A catalytically inactive Cys-to-Ser Ptp2p mutant (Ptp2(C/S)p) is tightly bound to tyrosine-phosphorylated Hog1p in vivo. Disruption of PTP2 leads to elevated levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated Hog1p following exposure of cells to high osmolarity. Disruption of both PTP2 and another protein tyrosine phosphatase gene, PTP3, results in constitutive Hog1p tyrosine phosphorylation even in the absence of increased osmolarity. Thus, Ptp2p and Ptp3p are the major phosphatases responsible for the tyrosine dephosphorylation of Hog1p. When catalytically inactive Hog1(K/N)p is expressed in hog1delta cells, it is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated. In contrast, Hog1(K/N)p, expressed together with wild-type Hog1p, is tyrosine phosphorylated only when cells are exposed to high osmolarity. Thus, the kinase activity of Hog1p is required for its own tyrosine dephosphorylation. Northern blot analyses suggest that Hog1p regulates Ptp2p and/or Ptp3p activity at the posttranscriptional level.},

abstract = {MAP kinase signaling modules serve to transduce extracellular signals to the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, but little is known about how signals cross the nuclear envelope. Exposure of yeast cells to increases in extracellular osmolarity activates the HOG1 MAP kinase cascade, which is composed of three tiers of protein kinases, namely the SSK2, SSK22 and STE11 MAPKKKs, the PBS2 MAPKK, and the HOG1 MAPK. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions of these kinases, we found that HOG1, PBS2 and STE11 localize to the cytoplasm of unstressed cells. Following osmotic stress, HOG1, but neither PBS2 nor STE11, translocates into the nucleus. HOG1 translocation occurs very rapidly, is transient, and correlates with the phosphorylation and activation of the MAP kinase by its MAPKK. HOG1 phosphorylation is necessary and sufficient for nuclear translocation, because a catalytically inactive kinase when phosphorylated is translocated to the nucleus as efficiently as the wild-type. Nuclear import of the MAPK under stress conditions requires the activity of the small GTP binding protein Ran-GSP1, but not the NLS-binding importin alpha/beta heterodimer. Rather, HOG1 import requires the activity of a gene, NMD5, that encodes a novel importin beta homolog. Similarly, export of dephosphorylated HOG1 from the nucleus requires the activity of the NES receptor XPO1/CRM1. Our findings define the requirements for the regulated nuclear transport of a stress-activated MAP kinase.},

abstract = {Exposure of yeast cells to increased extracellular osmolarity induces the HOG1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which is composed of SSK2, SSK22 and STE11 MAPKKKs, PBS2 MAPKK and HOG1 MAPK. The SSK2/SSK22 MAPKKKs are activated by a 'two-component' osmosensor composed of SLN1, YPD1 and SSK1. The SSK1 C-terminal receiver domain interacts with an N-terminal segment of SSK2. Upon hyperosmotic treatment, SSK2 is autophosphorylated rapidly, and this reaction requires the interaction of SSK1 with SSK2. Autophosphorylation of SSK2 is an intramolecular reaction, suggesting similarity to the mammalian MEKK1 kinase. Dephosphorylation of SSK2 renders the kinase inactive, but it can be re-activated by addition of SSK1 in vitro. A conserved threonine residue (Thr1460) in the activation loop of SSK2 is important for kinase activity. Based on these observations, we propose the following two-step activation mechanism of SSK2 MAPKKK. In the first step, the binding of SSK1 to the SSK1-binding site in the N-terminal domain of SSK2 causes a conformational change in SSK2 and induces its latent kinase activity. In the second step, autophosphorylation of SSK2 renders its activity independent of the presence of SSK1. A similar mechanism might be applicable to other MAPKKKs from both yeast and higher eukaryotes.},

abstract = {In this work we report the isolation and characterization of three genes induced by different stress conditions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These genes, named GRE1, GRE2 and GRE3, were identified by the differential display technique using total RNAs obtained from yeast grown under hyperosmotic conditions. Northern analysis of RNA obtained from different growth conditions shows that their corresponding transcripts accumulate not only in response to osmotic stress but also to ionic, oxidative and heat stress. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences indicated that GRE1, GRE2 and GRE3 correspond to ORFs YPL223C, YOL151W and YHR104W, respectively. Additionally, it suggested that GRE1 encodes a hydrophilic polypeptide that it is not homologous to any known protein but has features resembling the late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins characterized in higher plants; GRE2 encodes a putative reductase with similarity to plant dihydroflavonol-4-reductases; and GRE3 codifies for a keto-aldose reductase highly related to fungal xylose-reductases. The three genes are induced in the late growth phases in agreement with the presence of PDS elements in their promoter regions. The three of them are under the control of the HOG pathway, even though GRE1 and GRE2 promoter regions do not present the consensus core STRE sequence. In addition, GRE1 and GRE3 are regulated negatively by the cAMP-PKA transduction pathway and positively by the transcriptional factors Msn2p and Msn4p. Gene disruptions of the GRE genes did not show a phenotype in any of the tested stress conditions.},

abstract = {The accumulation of compatible solutes, such as glycerol, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a ubiquitous mechanism in cellular osmoregulation. Here, we demonstrate that yeast cells control glycerol accumulation in part via a regulated, Fps1p-mediated export of glycerol. Fps1p is a member of the MIP family of channel proteins most closely related to the bacterial glycerol facilitators. The protein is localized in the plasma membrane. The physiological role of Fps1p appears to be glycerol export rather than uptake. Fps1 delta mutants are sensitive to hypo-osmotic shock, demonstrating that osmolyte export is required for recovery from a sudden drop in external osmolarity. In wild-type cells, the glycerol transport rate is decreased by hyperosmotic shock and increased by hypo-osmotic shock on a subminute time scale. This regulation seems to be independent of the known yeast osmosensing HOG and PKC signalling pathways. Mutants lacking the unique hydrophilic N-terminal domain of Fps1p, or certain parts thereof, fail to reduce the glycerol transport rate after a hyperosmotic shock. Yeast cells carrying these constructs constitutively release glycerol and show a dominant hyperosmosensitivity, but compensate for glycerol loss after prolonged incubation by glycerol overproduction. Fps1p may be an example of a more widespread class of regulators of osmoadaptation, which control the cellular content and release of compatible solutes.},

Although Hog1 nuclear export correlates with its dephosphorylation, we find that dephosphorylation is not necessary for export. Unexpectedly, a strain lacking the nuclear protein tyrosine phosphatase, Ptp2, showed decreased Hog1 nuclear retention, while a strain lacking the cytoplasmic Ptp3 showed prolonged Hog1 nuclear accumulation, consistent with Ptp2 being a nuclear tether for Hog1 and Ptp3 being a cytoplasmic anchor. In support of this result PTP2 overexpression sequestered Hog1 in the nucleus while PTP3 overexpression restricted Hog1 to the cytoplasm. Thus, Ptp2 and Ptp3 regulate Hog1 localization by binding Hog1.},

Pbs2 tagged with green fluorescent protein (Pbs2-GFP) is evenly distributed in the cytoplasm but excluded from the nucleus before and after exposure to stress. Here we show that a catalytically inactive form of Pbs2 attains a highly polarised localization during osmostress. This phenomenon depends of the osmosensor Sho1 and on a functional Cdc42 GTPase. Cdc42, but not the actin cytoskeleton, influences Sho1-dependent activation of the MAP kinase. Sho1 itself accumulates at sites of polar growth, but independently of stress conditions and Cdc42. These observations allow us to define the sequence of events that occurs during propogation of osmostress signals.},

abstract = {Response to genotoxic stress can be considered as a multistage process involving initiation of cell-cycle arrest and maintenance of arrest during DNA repair. Although maintenance of G2/M checkpoints is known to involve Chk1, Chk2/Rad53 and upstream components, the mechanisms involved in its initiation are less well defined. Here we report that p38 kinase has a critical role in the initiation of a G2 delay after ultraviolet radiation. Inhibition of p38 blocks the rapid initiation of this checkpoint in both human and murine cells after ultraviolet radiation. In vitro, p38 binds and phosphorylates Cdc25B at serines 309 and 361, and Cdc25C at serine 216; phosphorylation of these residues is required for binding to 14-3-3 proteins. In vivo, inhibition of p38 prevents both phosphorylation of Cdc25B at serine 309 and 14-3-3 binding after ultraviolet radiation, and mutation of this site is sufficient to inhibit the checkpoint initiation. In contrast, in vivo Cdc25C binding to 14-3-3 is not affected by p38 inhibition after ultraviolet radiation. We propose that regulation of Cdc25B phosphorylation by p38 is a critical event for initiating the G2/M checkpoint after ultraviolet radiation.},

abstract = {Exposure of yeast to increases in extracellular osmolarity activates the Hog1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which is essential for the induction of gene expression required for cell survival upon osmotic stress. Several genes are regulated in response to osmotic stress by Sko1, a transcriptional repressor of the ATF/CREB family. We show by in vivo coprecipitation and phosphorylation studies that Sko1 and Hog1 interact and that Sko1 is phosphorylated upon osmotic stress in a Hog1-dependent manner. Hog1 phosphorylates Sko1 in vitro at multiple sites within the N-terminal region. Phosphorylation of Sko1 disrupts the Sko1-Ssn6-Tup1 repressor complex, and consistently, a mutant allele of Sko1, unphosphorylatable by Hog1, exhibits less derepression than the wild type. Interestingly, Sko1 repressor activity is further enhanced in strains with high protein kinase A (PKA) activity. PKA phosphorylates Sko1 near the bZIP domain and mutation of these sites eliminates modulation of Sko1 responses to high PKA activity. Thus, Sko1 transcriptional repression is controlled directly by the Hog1 MAPK in response to stress, and this effect is further modulated by an independent signaling mechanism through the PKA pathway.},

abstract = {A major part of the transcriptional response of yeast cells to osmotic shock is controlled by the HOG pathway and several downstream transcription factors. Sko1p is a repressor that mediates HOG pathway-dependent regulation by binding to CRE sites in target promoters. Here, we report five target genes of Hog1p-Sko1p: GRE2, AHP1, SFA1, GLR1 and YML131w. The two CREs in the GRE2 promoter function as activating sequences and, hence, bind (an) activator protein(s). However, the two other yeast CRE-binding proteins, Aca1p and Aca2p, are not involved in regulation of the GRE2 promoter under osmotic stress. In the absence of the co-repressor complex Tup1p-Ssn6p/Cyc8p, which is recruited by Sko1p, stimulation by osmotic stress is still observed. These data indicate that Sko1p is not only required for repression, but also involved in induction upon osmotic shock. All five Sko1p targets encode oxidoreductases with demonstrated or predicted roles in repair of oxidative damage. Altered basal expression levels of these genes in hog1Delta and sko1Delta mutants may explain the oxidative stress phenotypes of these mutants. All five Sko1p target genes are induced by oxidative stress, and induction involves Yap1p. Although Sko1p and Yap1p appear to mediate osmotic and oxidative stress responses independently, Sko1p may affect Yap1p promoter access or activity. The five Sko1p target genes described here are suitable models for studying the interplay between osmotic and oxidative responses at the molecular and physiological levels.},

abstract = {Ste11 is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase in the MAPK cascades that mediate mating, high osmolarity glycerol, and filamentous growth responses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show stimulation of the mating pathway by pheromone promotes an accelerated turnover of Ste11 through a MAPK feedback and ubiquitin-dependent mechanism. This degradation is pathway specific, because Ste11 is stable during activation of the high osmolarity glycerol pathway. Because the steady-state amount of Ste11 does not change significantly during pheromone induction, we infer that maintenance of MAPK activation involves repeated cycles in which naive Ste11 is activated and then targeted for degradation. This model predicts that elimination of active Ste11 would rapidly curtail MAPK activation upon attenuation of the upstream signal. This prediction is confirmed by the finding that blocking ubiquitin-dependent Ste11 degradation during pheromone induction abolishes the characteristic attenuation profile for MAPK activation.},

abstract = {Programmed cell death (PCD) is a fundamental cellular process conserved in metazoans, plants and yeast. Evidence is presented that salt induces PCD in yeast and plants because of an ionic, rather than osmotic, etiology. In yeast, NaCl inhibited growth and caused a time-dependent reduction in viability that was preceded by DNA fragmentation. NaCl also induced the cytological hallmarks of lysigenous-type PCD, including nuclear fragmentation, vacuolation and lysis. The human anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 increased salt tolerance of wild-type yeast strain and calcineurin-deficient yeast mutant (cnb1Delta) that is defective for ion homeostasis, but had no effect on the NaCl or sorbitol sensitivity of the osmotic hypersensitive hog1Delta mutant -- results that further link PCD in the response to the ion disequilibrium under salt stress. Bcl-2 suppression of cnb1Delta salt sensitivity was ENA1 (P-type ATPase gene)-dependent, due in part to transcriptional activation. Salt-induced PCD (TUNEL staining and DNA laddering) in primary roots of both Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (Col-1 gl1) and sos1 (salt overly sensitive) mutant seedlings correlated positively with treatment lethality. Wild-type plants survived salt stress levels that were lethal to sos1 plants because secondary roots were produced from the shoot/root transition zone. PCD-mediated elimination of the primary root in response to salt shock appears to be an adaptive mechanism that facilitates the production of roots more able to cope with a saline environment. Both salt-sensitive mutants of yeast (cnb1Delta) and Arabidopsis (sos1) exhibit substantially more profound PCD symptoms, indicating that salt-induced PCD is mediated by ion disequilibrium.},

abstract = {Two Saccharomyces cerevisiae plasma membrane-spanning proteins, Sho1 and Sln1, function during increased osmolarity to activate a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade. One of these proteins, Sho1, utilizes the MAP kinase kinase kinase Ste11 to activate Pbs2. We previously used the FUS1 gene of the pheromone response pathway as a reporter to monitor cross talk in hog1 mutants. Cross talk requires the Sho1-Ste11 branch of the HOG pathway, but some residual signaling, which is STE11 dependent, still occurs in the absence of Sho1. These observations led us to propose the existence of another osmosensor upstream of Ste11. To identify such an osmosensor, we screened for mutants in which the residual signaling in a hog1 sho1 mutant was further reduced. We identified the MSB2 gene, which encodes a protein with a single membrane-spanning domain and a large presumptive extracellular domain. Assay of the FUS1-lacZ reporter (in a hog1 mutant background) showed that sho1 and msb2 mutations both reduced the expression of the reporter partially and that the hog1 sho1 msb2 mutant was severely defective in the expression of the reporter. The use of DNA microarrays to monitor gene expression revealed that Sho1 and Msb2 regulate identical gene sets in hog1 mutants. A role for MSB2 in HOG1 strains was also seen in strains defective in the two known branches that activate Pbs2: an ssk1 sho1 msb2 strain was more osmosensitive than an ssk1 sho1 MSB2 strain. These observations indicate that Msb2 is partially redundant with the Sho1 osmosensing branch for the activation of Ste11.},

The Hot1 transcription factor acts downstream of the MAPK and regulates a subset of Hog1-responsive genes. In response to high osmolarity, Hot1 targets Hog1 to specific osmostress-responsive promoters. Here, we show that assembly of the general transcription machinery at Hot1-dependent promoters depends on the presence of Hot1 and active Hog1 MAPK. Unexpectedly, recruitment of RNA polymerase (Pol) II complex to target promoters does not depend on the phosphorylation of the Hot1 activator by the MAPK. Hog1 interacts with the RNA Pol II and with general components of the transcription machinery. More over, when tethered to a promoter as a LexA fusion protein, Hog1 activates transcription in a stress- regulated manner. Thus, anchoring of active Hog1 to promoters by the Hot1 activator is essential for recruitment and activation of RNA Pol II. The mammalian p38 also interacts with the RNA Pol II, which might suggest a conserved mechanism for regulation of gene expression by SAPKs among eukaryotic cells.},

abstract = {Mitogen-activated protein kinases are crucial components in the life of eukaryotic cells. The current dogma for MAPK activation is that dual phosphorylation of neighboring Thr and Tyr residues at the phosphorylation lip is an absolute requirement for their catalytic and biological activity. In this study we addressed the role of Tyr and Thr phosphorylation in the yeast MAPK Hog1/p38. Taking advantage of the recently isolated hyperactive mutants, whose intrinsic basal activity is independent of upstream regulation, we demonstrate that Tyr-176 is not required for basal catalytic and biological activity but is essential for the salt-induced amplification of Hog1 catalysis. We show that intact Thr-174 is absolutely essential for biology and catalysis of the mutants but is mainly required for structural reasons and not as a phosphoacceptor. The roles of Thr-174 and Tyr-176 in wild type Hog1 molecules were also tested. Unexpectedly we found that Hog1(Y176F) is biologically active, capable of induction of Hog1 target genes and of rescuing hog1Delta cells from osmotic stress. Hog1(Y176F) was not able, however, to mediate growth arrest induced by constitutively active MAPK kinase/Pbs2. We propose that Thr-174 is essential for stabilizing the basal active conformation, whereas Tyr-176 is not. Tyr-176 serves as a regulatory element required for stimuli-induced amplification of kinase activity.},

abstract = {Exposure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to increases in extracellular osmolarity activates the stress-activated Hog1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which is essential for cell survival upon osmotic stress. Yeast cells respond to osmotic stress by inducing the expression of a very large number of genes, and the Hog1 MAPK plays a critical role in gene transcription upon stress. To understand how Hog1 controls gene expression, we designed a genetic screen to isolate new transcription factors under the control of the MAPK and identified the MEF2-like transcription factor, Smp1, as a target for Hog1. Overexpression of SMP1 induced Hog1-dependent expression of osmoresponsive genes such as STL1, whereas smp1$\Delta$ cells were defective in their expression. Consistently, smp1$\Delta$ cells displayed reduced viability upon osmotic shock. In vivo coprecipitation and phosphorylation studies showed that Smp1 and Hog1 interact and that Smp1 is phosphorylated upon osmotic stress in a Hog1-dependent manner. Hog1 phosphorylated Smp1 in vitro at the C-terminal region. Phosphorylation of Smp1 by the MAPK is essential for its function, since a mutant allele unable to be phosphorylated by the MAPK displays impaired stress responses. Thus, our data indicate that Smp1 acts downstream of Hog1, controlling a subset of the responses induced by the MAPK. Moreover, Smp1 concentrates in the nucleus during the stationary phase, and the lack of SMP1 results in cells that lose viability in the stationary phase. Localization of Smp1 depends on HOG1, and consistently, hog1$\Delta$ cells also lose viability during this growth phase. These data suggest that Smp1 could be mediating a role for the Hog1 MAPK during the stationary phase.},

abstract = {Pathway specificity is poorly understood for mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades that control different outputs in response to different stimuli. In yeast, it is not known how the same MAPK cascade activates Kss1 MAPK to promote invasive growth (IG) and proliferation, and both Fus3 and Kss1 MAPKs to promote mating. Previous work has suggested that the Kss1 MAPK cascade is activated independently of the mating G protein (Ste4)-scaffold (Ste5) system during IG. Here we demonstrate that Ste4 and Ste5 activate Kss1 during IG and in response to multiple stimuli including butanol. Ste5 activates Kss1 by generating a pool of active MAPKKK (Ste11), whereas additional scaffolding is needed to activate Fus3. Scaffold-independent activation of Kss1 can occur at multiple steps in the pathway, whereas Fus3 is strictly dependent on the scaffold. Pathway specificity is linked to Kss1 immunity to a MAPK phosphatase that constitutively inhibits basal activation of Fus3 and blocks activation of the mating pathway. These findings reveal the versatility of scaffolds and how a single MAPK cascade mediates different outputs.},

abstract = {Activation of stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) is essential for proper cell adaptation to extracellular stimuli. The exposure of yeast cells to high osmolarity, or mutations that lead to activation of the Hog1 SAPK, result in cell-cycle arrest. The mechanisms by which Hog1 and SAPKs in general regulate cell-cycle progression are not completely understood. Here we show that Hog1 regulates cell cycle progression at the G1 phase by a dual mechanism that involves downregulation of cyclin expression and direct targeting of the CDK-inhibitor protein Sic1. Hog1 interacts physically with Sic1 in vivo and in vitro, and phosphorylates a single residue at the carboxyl terminus of Sic1, which, in combination with the downregulation of cyclin expression, results in Sic1 stabilization and inhibition of cell-cycle progression. Cells lacking Sic1 or containing a Sic1 allele mutated in the Hog1 phosphorylation site are unable to arrest at G1 phase after Hog1 activation, and become sensitive to osmostress. Together, our data indicate that the Sic1 CDK-inhibitor is the molecular target for the SAPK Hog1 that is required to modulate cell-cycle progression in response to stress.},

abstract = {The Saccharomyces cerevisiae high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is required for osmoadaptation and contains two branches that activate a mitogen-activated protein kinase (Hog1) via a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (Pbs2). We have characterized the roles of common pathway components (Hog1 and Pbs2) and components in the two upstream branches (Ste11, Sho1, and Ssk1) in response to elevated osmolarity by using whole-genome expression profiling. Several new features of the HOG pathway were revealed. First, Hog1 functions during gene induction and repression, cross talk inhibition, and in governing the regulatory period. Second, the phenotypes of pbs2 and hog1 mutants are identical, indicating that the sole role of Pbs2 is to activate Hog1. Third, the existence of genes whose induction is dependent on Hog1 and Pbs2 but not on Ste11 and Ssk1 suggests that there are additional inputs into Pbs2 under our inducing conditions. Fourth, the two upstream pathway branches are not redundant: the Sln1-Ssk1 branch has a much more prominent role than the Sho1-Ste11 branch for activation of Pbs2 by modest osmolarity. Finally, the general stress response pathway and both branches of the HOG pathway all function at high osmolarity. These studies demonstrate that cells respond to increased osmolarity by using different signal transduction machinery under different conditions.},

Simulations agree well with experimental results obtained under different stress conditions or with specific mutants. The model is predictive since it suggests previously unrecognized features of the system with respect to osmolyte accumulation and feedback control, as confirmed with experiments.

abstract = {The yeast high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signaling pathway can be activated by either of the two upstream pathways, termed the SHO1 and SLN1 branches. When stimulated by high osmolarity, the SHO1 branch activates an MAP kinase module composed of the Ste11 MAPKKK, the Pbs2 MAPKK, and the Hog1 MAPK. To investigate how osmostress activates this MAPK module, we isolated both gain-of-function and loss-of-function alleles in four key genes involved in the SHO1 branch, namely SHO1, CDC42, STE50, and STE11. These mutants were characterized using an HOG-dependent reporter gene, 8xCRE-lacZ. We found that Cdc42, in addition to binding and activating the PAK-like kinases Ste20 and Cla4, binds to the Ste11-Ste50 complex to bring activated Ste20/Cla4 to their substrate Ste11. Activated Ste11 and its HOG pathway-specific substrate, Pbs2, are brought together by Sho1; the Ste11-Ste50 complex binds to the cytoplasmic domain of Sho1, to which Pbs2 also binds. Thus, Cdc42, Ste50, and Sho1 act as adaptor proteins that control the flow of the osmostress signal from Ste20/Cla4 to Ste11, then to Pbs2.},

abstract = {When confronted with a marked increase in external osmolarity, budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells utilize a conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade (the high-osmolarity glycerol or HOG pathway) to elicit cellular responses necessary to permit continued growth. One input that stimulates the HOG pathway requires the integral membrane protein and putative osmosensor Sho1, which recruits and enables activation of the MAPK kinase kinase Ste11. In mutants that lack the downstream MAPK kinase (pbs2Delta) or the MAPK (hog1Delta) of the HOG pathway, Ste11 activated by hyperosmotic stress is able to inappropriately stimulate the pheromone response pathway. This loss of signaling specificity is known as cross talk. To determine whether it is the Hog1 polypeptide per se or its kinase activity that is necessary to prevent cross talk, we constructed a fully functional analog-sensitive allele of HOG1 to permit acute inhibition of this enzyme without other detectable perturbations of the cell. We found that the catalytic activity of Hog1 is required continuously to prevent cross talk between the HOG pathway and both the pheromone response and invasive growth pathways. Moreover, contrary to previous reports, we found that the kinase activity of Hog1 is necessary for its stress-induced nuclear import. Finally, our results demonstrate a role for active Hog1 in maintaining signaling specificity under conditions of persistently high external osmolarity.},

Both Ste11p and Ste50p contain sterile alpha motif (SAM) domains; these are interchangeable, and can be replaced by other protein-interacting modules. Furthermore, the function of the Ras association (RA)-like domain of Ste50p can be mimicked by a plasma membrane recruiting signal, and direct plasma membrane targeting of Ste11p bypasses the requirement of Ste50p for Ste11p function. Thus the regulatory role of Ste50p requires both the N-terminal SAM domain to bind Ste11p and the C-terminal RA-like domain to direct kinase localization. We have identified Opy2p, an integral membrane protein that can interact with Ste50p, as a new component in the Sho1p-Ste11p/Ste50p signaling branch of the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway. We propose that Opy2p can serve as a membrane anchor for the Ste50p/Ste11p module in the activation of the HOG pathway.},

abstract = {Intracellular signaling pathways that share common components often elicit distinct physiological responses. In most cases, the biochemical mechanisms responsible for this signal specificity remain poorly understood. Protein scaffolds and cross-inhibition have been proposed as strategies to prevent unwanted cross-talk. Here, we report a mechanism for signal specificity termed "kinetic insulation." In this approach signals are selectively transmitted through the appropriate pathway based on their temporal profile. In particular, we demonstrate how pathway architectures downstream of a common component can be designed to efficiently separate transient signals from signals that increase slowly over time. Furthermore, we demonstrate that upstream signaling proteins can generate the appropriate input to the common pathway component regardless of the temporal profile of the external stimulus. Our results suggest that multilevel signaling cascades may have evolved to modulate the temporal profile of pathway activity so that stimulus information can be efficiently encoded and transmitted while ensuring signal specificity.},

abstract = {We perform a systematic analysis of mechanisms of feedback regulation that underlie short-term adaptation in intracellular signaling systems. Upon receiving an external cue, these systems generate a transient response that quickly returns to basal levels even if the stimulus persists. Signaling pathways capable of short-term adaptation are found in systems as diverse as the high osmolarity response of yeast, gradient sensing in Dictyostelium, and the cytokine response in vertebrates. Using mathematical analysis and computational experiments, we compare different feedback architectures in terms of response amplitude and duration, ability to adapt, and response to variable stimulus levels. Our analysis reveals three important features of these systems: 1), multiple step signaling cascades improve sensitivity to low doses by an effect distinct from signal amplification; 2), some feedback architectures act as signal transducers converting stimulus strength into response duration; and 3), feedback deactivation acts as a dose-dependent switch between transient and sustained responses. Finally, we present characteristic features for each form of feedback regulation that can aid in their identification.},

MEKK4 can replace all of the known functions of Ssk2p in yeast, including functioning in the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) MAPK pathway and the recently described actin recovery pathway. MEKK4 and Ssk2p share a number of conserved domains and appear to be activated by a similar mechanism. Binding of an activating protein to the N-terminal region alleviates auto-inhibition and causes the kinase to auto-phosphorylate, resulting in activation. In this review we will examine the role of the MAP kinase kinase kinase isoform Ssk2p/MEKK4 in the adaptation of both yeast and mammalian systems to specific external stimuli. Recent work has provided a wealth of information about the activation, regulation, and functions of these MEKK kinases to extra-cellular signals. We will also highlight evidence supporting a role for MEKK4 in mediating actin recovery following osmotic shock in mammalian cells.},

abstract = {Osmotic stress induces activation of an adaptive mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in concert with disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton by a mechanism that is not understood. We have previously shown that the conserved actin-interacting MAP kinase kinase kinase Ssk2p/MEKK4, a member of the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) MAPK pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mediates recovery of the actin cytoskeleton following osmotic stress. In this study, we have employed in vitro kinase assays to show that Ssk2p kinase activity is activated for the actin recovery pathway via a noncanonical, Ssk1p-independent mechanism. Our work also shows that Ssk2p requires the polarisome proteins Bud6p and Pea2p to promote efficient, polarized actin reassembly but that this requirement can be bypassed by overexpression of Ssk2p. Formin (BNI1 or BNR1) and tropomyosin functions are also required for actin recovery but, unlike for Bud6p and Pea2p, these requirements cannot be bypassed by overexpression of Ssk2p. These results suggest that Ssk2p acts downstream of Bud6p and Pea2p and upstream of tropomyosin to drive actin recovery, possibly by upregulating the actin nucleation activity of the formins.},

abstract = {Background: A common property of signal transduction systems is that they rapidly lose their ability to respond to a given stimulus. For instance in yeast, the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase Hog1 is activated and inactivated within minutes, even when the osmotic-stress stimulus is sustained. Results: Here, we used a combination of experimental and computational analyses to investigate the dynamic behavior of Hog1 activation in vivo. Computational modeling suggested that a negative-feedback loop operates early in the pathway and leads to rapid attenuation of Hog1 signaling. Experimental analysis revealed that the membrane-bound osmosensor Sho1 is phosphorylated by Hog1 and that phosphorylation occurs on Ser-166. Moreover, Sho1 exists in a homo-oligomeric complex, and phosphorylation by Hog1 promotes a transition from the oligomeric to monomeric state. A phosphorylation-site mutation (Sho1S166E) diminishes the formation of Sho1-oligomers, dampens activation of the Hog1 kinase, and impairs growth in high-salt or sorbitol conditions. Conclusions: These findings reveal a novel phosphorylation-dependent feedback loop leading to diminished cellular responses to an osmotic-stress stimulus. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Hohmann2007,
abstract = {Osmoregulation is the active control of the cellular water balance and encompasses homeostatic mechanisms crucial for life. The osmoregulatory system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is particularly well understood. Key to yeast osmoregulation is the production and accumulation of the compatible solute glycerol, which is partly controlled by the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signaling system. Genetic analyses combined with studies on protein-protein interactions have revealed the wiring scheme of the HOG signaling network, a branched mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (MAPK) pathway that eventually converges on the MAPK Hog1. Hog1 is activated following cell shrinking and controls posttranscriptional processes in the cytosol as well as gene expression in the nucleus. HOG pathway activity can easily and rapidly be controlled experimentally by extracellular stimuli, and signaling and adaptation can be separated by a system of forced adaptation. This makes yeast osmoregulation suitable for studies on system properties of signaling and cellular adaptation via mathematical modeling. Computational simulations and parallel quantitative time course experimentation on different levels of the regulatory system have provided a stepping stone toward a holistic understanding, revealing how the HOG pathway can combine rigorous feedback control with maintenance of signaling competence. The abundant tools make yeast a suitable model for an integrated analysis of cellular osmoregulation. Maintenance of the cellular water balance is fundamental for life. All cells, even those in multicellular organisms with an organism-wide osmoregulation, have the ability to actively control their water balance. Osmoregulation encompasses homeostatic processes that maintain an appropriate intracellular environment for biochemical processes as well as turgor of cells and organism. In the laboratory, the osmoregulatory system is studied most conveniently as a response to osmotic shock, causing rapid and dramatic changes in the extracellular water activity. Those rapid changes mediate either water efflux (hyperosmotic shock), and hence cell shrinkage, or influx (hypoosmotic shock), causing cell swelling. The yeast S. cerevisiae, as a free-living organism experiencing both slow and rapid changes in extracellular water activity, has proven a suitable and genetically tractable experimental system in studying the underlying signaling pathways and regulatory processes governing osmoregulation. Although far from complete, the present picture of yeast osmoregulation is both extensive and detailed (de Nadal et al., 2002; Hohmann, 2002; Klipp et al., 2005). Simulations using mathematical models combined with time course measurements of different molecular processes in signaling and adaptation have allowed elucidation of the first system properties on the yeast osmoregulatory network.},

abstract = {Aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins form the membrane channels that mediate fluxes of water and small solute molecules into and out of cells. Eukaryotes often use mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades for the intracellular signaling of stress. This study reveals an aquaglyceroporin being destabilized by direct MAPK phosphorylation and also a stress resistance being acquired through this channel loss. Hog1 MAPK is transiently activated in yeast exposed to high, toxic levels of acetic acid. This Hog1 then phosphorylates the plasma membrane aquaglyceroporin, Fps1, a phosphorylation that results in Fps1 becoming ubiquitinated and endocytosed and then degraded in the vacuole. As Fps1 is the membrane channel that facilitates passive diffusional flux of undissociated acetic acid into the cell, this loss downregulates such influx in low-pH cultures, where acetic acid (pKa, 4.75) is substantially undissociated. Consistent with this downregulation of the acid entry generating resistance, sensitivity to acetic acid is seen with diverse mutational defects that abolish endocytic removal of Fps1 from the plasma membrane (loss of Hog1, loss of the soluble domains of Fps1, a T231A S537A double mutation of Fps1 that prevents its in vivo phosphorylation, or mutations generating a general loss of endocytosis of cell surface proteins [doa4Delta and end3Delta]). Remarkably, targetting of Fps1 for degradation may be the major requirement for an active Hog1 in acetic acid resistance, since Hog1 is largely dispensable for such resistance when the cells lack Fps1. Evidence is presented that in unstressed cells, Hog1 exists in physical association with the N-terminal cytosolic domain of Fps1.},

Activated Hog1 regulates the cell cycle, protein translation, and gene expression. Upstream of the HOG pathway are functionally redundant SLN1 and SHO1 signaling branches. However, neither the osmosensor nor the signal generator of the SHO1 branch has been clearly defined. Here, we show that the mucin-like transmembrane proteins Hkr1 and Msb2 are the potential osmosensors for the SHO1 branch. Hyperactive forms of Hkr1 and Msb2 can activate the HOG pathway only in the presence of Sho1, whereas a hyperactive Sho1 mutant activates the HOG pathway in the absence of both Hkr1 and Msb2, indicating that Hkr1 and Msb2 are the most upstream elements known so far in the SHO1 branch. Hkr1 and Msb2 individually form a complex with Sho1, and, upon high external osmolarity stress, appear to induce Sho1 to generate an intracellular signal. Furthermore, Msb2, but not Hkr1, can also generate an intracellular signal in a Sho1-independent manner.},

abstract = {Functional interactions between a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and its regulators require specific docking interactions. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which the yeast osmoregulatory Hog1 MAPK specifically interacts with its activator, the MAPK kinase Pbs2, and its major inactivator, the protein phosphatase Ptp2. We found, in the N-terminal noncatalytic region of Pbs2, a specific Hog1-binding domain, termed HBD-1. We also defined two adjacent Pbs2-binding sites in Hog1, namely, the common docking (CD) domain and Pbs2-binding domain 2 (PBD-2). The PBD-2 docking site appears to be sterically blocked in the intact Hog1 molecule, but its affinity to Pbs2 is apparent in shorter fragments of Hog1. Both the CD and the PBD-2 docking sites are required for the optimal activation of Hog1 by Pbs2, and in the absence of both sites, Hog1 cannot be activated by Pbs2. These data suggest that the initial interaction of Pbs2 with the CD site might induce a conformational change in Hog1 so that the PBD-2 site becomes accessible. The CD and PBD-2 docking sites are also involved in the specific interaction between Hog1 and Ptp2 and govern the dynamic dephosphorylation of activated Hog1. Thus, the CD and the PBD-2 docking sites play critical roles in both the activation and inactivation of Hog1.},

abstract = {Negative feedback can serve many different cellular functions, including noise reduction in transcriptional networks and the creation of circadian oscillations. However, only one special type of negative feedback ("integral feedback") ensures perfect adaptation, where steady-state output is independent of steady-state input. Here we quantitatively measure single-cell dynamics in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae hyperosmotic shock network, which regulates membrane turgor pressure. Importantly, we find that the nuclear enrichment of the MAP kinase Hog1 perfectly adapts to changes in external osmolarity, a feature robust to signaling fidelity and operating with very low noise. By monitoring multiple system quantities (e.g., cell volume, Hog1, glycerol) and using varied input waveforms (e.g., steps and ramps), we assess in a minimally invasive manner the network location of the mechanism responsible for perfect adaptation. We conclude that the system contains only one effective integrating mechanism, which requires Hog1 kinase activity and regulates glycerol synthesis but not leakage.},

abstract = {Hyperosmotic stress yields reprogramming of gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. Most of this response is orchestrated by Hog1, a stress-activated, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) homologous to human p38. We investigated, on a genomic scale, the contribution of changes in transcription rates and mRNA stabilities to the modulation of mRNA amounts during the response to osmotic stress in wild-type and hog1 mutant cells. Mild osmotic shock induces a broad mRNA destabilization; however, osmo-mRNAs are up-regulated by increasing both transcription rates and mRNA half-lives. In contrast, mild or severe osmotic stress in hog1 mutants, or severe osmotic stress in wild-type cells, yields global mRNA stabilization and sequestration of mRNAs into P-bodies. After adaptation, the absence of Hog1 affects the kinetics of P-bodies disassembly and the return of mRNAs to translation. Our results indicate that regulation of mRNA turnover contributes to coordinate gene expression upon osmotic stress, and that there are both specific and global controls of mRNA stability depending on the strength of the osmotic stress.},

@article{Yaakov2009,
abstract = {Control of cell cycle progression by stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) is essential for cell adaptation to extracellular stimuli. Exposure of yeast to osmostress activates the Hog1 SAPK, which modulates cell cycle progression at G1 and G2 by the phosphorylation of elements of the cell cycle machinery, such as Sic1 and Hsl1, and by down-regulation of G1 and G2 cyclins. Here, we show that upon stress, Hog1 also modulates S phase progression. The control of S phase is independent of the S phase DNA damage checkpoint and of the previously characterized Hog1 cell cycle targets Sic1 and Hsl1. Hog1 uses at least two distinct mechanisms in its control over S phase progression. At early S phase, the SAPK prevents firing of replication origins by delaying the accumulation of the S phase cyclins Clb5 and Clb6. In addition, Hog1 prevents S phase progression when activated later in S phase or cells containing a genetic bypass for cyclin-dependent kinase activity. Hog1 interacts with components of the replication complex and delays phosphorylation of the Dpb2 subunit of the DNA polymerase. The two mechanisms of Hog1 action lead to delayed firing of origins and prolonged replication, respectively. The Hog1-dependent delay of replication could be important to allow Hog1 to induce gene expression before replication.},

abstract = {Membrane localization of the Ste11 MAPKKK is essential for activation of both the filamentous growth/invasive growth (FG/IG) MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway and the SHO1 branch of the osmoregulatory HOG MAPK pathway, and is mediated by binding of the Ste50 scaffold protein to the Opy2 membrane anchor. We found that Opy2 has two major (CR-A and CR-B), and one minor (CR-D), binding sites for Ste50. CR-A binds Ste50 constitutively and can transmit signals to both the Hog1 and Fus3/Kss1 MAPKs. CR-B, in contrast, binds Ste50 only when Opy2 is phosphorylated by Yck1/Yck2 under glucose-rich conditions and transmits the signal preferentially to the Hog1 MAPK. Ste50 phosphorylation by activated Hog1/Fus3/Kss1 MAPKs downregulates the HOG MAPK pathway by dissociating Ste50 from Opy2. Furthermore, Ste50 phosphorylation, together with MAPK-specific protein phosphatases, reduces the basal activity of the HOG and the mating MAPK pathways. Thus, dynamic regulation of Ste50-Opy2 interaction fine-tunes the MAPK signaling network.},

abstract = {The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway is comprised of a three-tiered kinase cascade. The distributive kinetic mechanism of two-site MAP kinase phosphorylation inherently generates a nonlinear switch-like response. However, a linear graded response of MAP kinase has also been observed in mammalian cells, and its molecular mechanism remains unclear. To dissect these input-output behaviors, we quantitatively measured the kinetic parameters involved in the MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase)-ERK MAP kinase signaling module in HeLa cells. Using a numerical analysis based on experimentally determined parameters, we predicted in silico and validated in vivo that ERK is processively phosphorylated in HeLa cells. Finally, we identified molecular crowding as a critical factor that converts distributive phosphorylation into processive phosphorylation. We proposed the term quasi-processive phosphorylation to describe this mode of ERK phosphorylation that is operated under the physiological condition of molecular crowding. The generality of this phenomenon may provide a new paradigm for a diverse set of biochemical reactions including multiple posttranslational modifications.},

When investigating the dynamic interplay between Hog1 activation and Hog1-driven gene expression, we found that Hog1 activation increases linearly with stimulus, whereas the transcriptional output is bimodal. Modeling predictions, corroborated by single-cell experiments, established that a slow stochastic transition from a repressed to an activated transcriptional state in conjunction with transient Hog1 activation generates this behavior. Together, these findings provide a molecular mechanism by which a cell can impose a transcriptional threshold in response to a linear signaling behavior.},

Whereas proper mating requires Ste7 activation of the MAP kinase Fus3, invasive growth requires activation of the alternate MAP kinase Kss1. To determine how MAP kinase specificity is achieved, we used a series of mathematical models to quantitatively characterize pheromone-stimulated kinase activation. In accordance with the computational analysis, MAP kinase feedback phosphorylation of Ste7 results in diminished activation of Kss1, but not Fus3. These findings reveal how feedback phosphorylation of a common pathway component can limit the activity of a competing MAP kinase through feedback phosphorylation of a common activator, and thereby promote signal fidelity.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic cells have evolved mechanisms for ensuring growth and survival in the face of stress caused by a fluctuating environment. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two homologous glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenases, Gpd1 and Gpd2, that are required to endure various stresses, including hyperosmotic shock and hypoxia. These enzymes are only partially redundant, and their unique functions were attributed previously to differential transcriptional regulation and localization. We find that Gpd1 and Gpd2 are negatively regulated through phosphorylation by distinct kinases under reciprocal conditions. Gpd2 is phosphorylated by the AMP-activated protein kinase Snf1 to curtail glycerol production when nutrients are limiting. Gpd1, in contrast, is a target of TORC2-dependent kinases Ypk1 and Ypk2. Inactivation of Ypk1 by hyperosmotic shock results in dephosphorylation and activation of Gpd1, accelerating recovery through increased glycerol production. Gpd1 dephosphorylation acts synergistically with its transcriptional upregulation, enabling long-term growth at high osmolarity. Phosphorylation of Gpd1 and Gpd2 by distinct kinases thereby enables rapid adaptation to specific stress conditions. Introduction of phosphorylation motifs targeted by distinct kinases provides a general mechanism for functional specialization of duplicated genes during evolution.},

abstract = {All eukaryotes have the ability to detect and respond to environmental and hormonal signals. In many cases these signals evoke cellular changes that are incompatible and must therefore be orchestrated by the responding cell. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, hyperosmotic stress and mating pheromones initiate signaling cascades that each terminate with a MAP kinase, Hog1 and Fus3, respectively. Despite sharing components, these pathways are initiated by distinct inputs and produce distinct cellular behaviors. To understand how these responses are coordinated, we monitored the pheromone response during hyperosmotic conditions. We show that hyperosmotic stress limits pheromone signaling in at least three ways. First, stress delays the expression of pheromone-induced genes. Second, stress promotes the phosphorylation of a protein kinase, Rck2, and thereby inhibits pheromone-induced protein translation. Third, stress promotes the phosphorylation of a shared pathway component, Ste50, and thereby dampens pheromone-induced MAPK activation. Whereas all three mechanisms are dependent on an increase in osmolarity, only the phosphorylation events require Hog1. These findings reveal how an environmental stress signal is able to postpone responsiveness to a competing differentiation signal, by acting on multiple pathway components, in a coordinated manner.},

abstract = {The Caenorhabditis elegans ASER sensory neuron is excited when environmental NaCl concentration is decreased. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) MPK-1, a homolog of ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), is activated during excitation of ASER sensory neurons. We created and expressed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based MAPK activity probe in ASER neurons and then exposed the worms to various cyclic patterns of stimulation (changes in NaCl concentration) to monitor the dynamics of MPK-1 activity. We found that the intensity and duration of MPK-1 activity were determined by the temporal pattern of stimulation, namely, a combination of stimulation period length, stimulation duration, and time between stimuli. The complex, nonlinear relationship between stimulation and MPK-1 activation was explained by the properties of intracellular calcium responses upstream of MPK-1. Thus, we visualized the dynamics of MAPK activation in a sensory neuron in living nematodes in response to complex stimuli and present a reporter that can be used in higher eukaryotes to test in silico predictions regarding the MAPK pathway.},

abstract = {Scaffolding proteins add a new layer of complexity to the dynamics of cell signaling. Above their basic function to bring several components of a signaling pathway together, recent experimental research has found that scaffolds influence signaling in a much more complex way: scaffolds can exert some catalytic function, influence signaling by allosteric mechanisms, are feedback-regulated, localize signaling activity to distinct regions of the cell or increase pathway fidelity. Here we review experimental and theoretical approaches that address the function of two MAPK scaffolds, Ste5, a scaffold of the yeast mating pathway and KSR1/2, a scaffold of the classical mammalian MAPK signaling pathway. For the yeast scaffold Ste5, detailed mechanistic models have been valuable for the understanding of its function. For scaffolds in mammalian signaling, however, models have been rather generic and sketchy. For example, these models predicted narrow optimal scaffold concentrations, but when revisiting these models by assuming typical concentrations, rather a range of scaffold levels optimally supports signaling. Thus, more realistic models are needed to understand the role of scaffolds in mammalian signal transduction, which opens a big opportunity for systems biology.},

abstract = {Signal transmission progresses via a series of transient protein-protein interactions and protein movements, which require diffusion within a cell packed with different molecules. Yeast Hog1, the effector protein kinase of the High Osmolarity Glycerol pathway, translocates transiently from the cytosol to the nucleus during adaptation to high external osmolarity. We followed the dynamics of osmostress-induced cell volume loss and Hog1 nuclear accumulation upon exposure of cells to different NaCl concentrations. While Hog1 nuclear accumulation peaked within five minutes following mild osmotic shock it was delayed up to six-fold under severe stress. The timing of Hog1 nuclear accumulation correlated with the degree of cell volume loss and the cells capacity to recover. Also the nuclear translocation of Msn2, the transcription factor of the general stress response pathway, is delayed upon severe osmotic stress suggesting a general phenomenon. We show by direct measurements that the general diffusion rate of Hog1 in the cytoplasm as well as its rate of nuclear transport are dramatically reduced following severe volume reduction. However, neither Hog1 phosphorylation nor Msn2 nuclear translocation were as much delayed as Hog1 nuclear translocation. Our data provide direct evidence that signaling slows down during cell volume compression, probably as a consequence of molecular crowding. Hence one purpose of osmotic adaptation is to restore optimal diffusion rates for biochemical and cell biological processes. In addition, there may be mechanisms slowing down especially Hog1 nuclear translocation under severe stress in order to prioritize Hog1 cytosolic targets.},

abstract = {Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification that tags proteins for proteasomal degradation. In addition, there is a growing appreciation that ubiquitination can influence protein activity and localization. Ste7 is a prototype MAPKK in yeast that participates in both the pheromone signaling and nutrient deprivation/invasive growth pathways. We have shown previously that Ste7 is ubiquitinated upon pheromone stimulation. Here, we show that the Skp1/Cullin/F-box ubiquitin ligase SCF(Cdc4) and the ubiquitin protease Ubp3 regulate Ste7 ubiquitination and signal specificity. Using purified components, we demonstrate that SCF(Cdc4) ubiquitinates Ste7 directly. Using gene deletion mutants, we show that SCF(Cdc4) and Ubp3 have opposing effects on Ste7 ubiquitination. Although SCF(Cdc4) is necessary for proper activation of the pheromone MAPK Fus3, Ubp3 is needed to limit activation of the invasive growth MAPK Kss1. Finally, we show that Fus3 phosphorylates Ubp3 directly and that phosphorylation of Ubp3 is necessary to limit Kss1 activation. These results reveal a feedback loop wherein one MAPK limits the ubiquitination of an upstream MAPKK and thereby prevents spurious activation of a second competing MAPK.},

@article{Lee2013,
abstract = {The aquaglyceroprin Fps1 is responsible for glycerol transport in yeast in response to changes in extracellular osmolarity. Control of Fps1 channel activity in response to hyperosmotic shock involves a redundant pair of regulators, Rgc1 (regulator of the glycerol channel 1) and Rgc2, and the MAPK Hog1 (high-osmolarity glycerol response 1). However, the mechanism by which these factors influence channel activity is unknown. We show that Rgc2 maintains Fps1 in the open channel state in the absence of osmotic stress by binding to its C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. This interaction involves a tripartite pleckstrin homology (PH) domain within Rgc2 and a partial PH domain within Fps1. Activation of Hog1 in response to hyperosmotic shock induces the rapid eviction of Rgc2 from Fps1 and consequent channel closure. Hog1 was recruited to the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Fps1, which it uses as a platform from which to multiply phosphorylate Rgc2. Thus, these results reveal the mechanism by which Hog1 regulates Fps1 in response to hyperosmotic shock.},

We generate models with varying complexity and use parameter estimation and cross-validation analyses to select the most predictive model. This model yields insight into several dynamical features, including multistep regulation and switchlike activation for several osmosensitive genes. Furthermore, the model correctly predicts the transcriptional dynamics of cells in response to different environmental and genetic perturbations. Because our approach is general, it should facilitate a predictive understanding for signal-activated transcription of other genes in other pathways or organisms.},

abstract = {We have identified Cdc55, a regulatory B subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), as an essential activating factor for stress gene transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The presence of PP2A-Cdc55 is required for full activation of the environmental stress response mediated by the transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4. We show that PP2A-Cdc55 contributes to sustained nuclear accumulation of Msn2 and Msn4 during hyperosmolarity stress. PP2A-Cdc55 also enhances Msn2-dependent transactivation, required for extended chromatin recruitment of the transcription factor. We analyzed a possible direct regulatory role for PP2A-Cdc55 on the phosphorylation status of Msn2. Detailed mass spectrometric and genetic analysis of Msn2 showed that stress exposure causes immediate transient dephosphorylation of Msn2 which is not dependent on PP2A-Cdc55 activity. Furthermore, the Hog1 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activity is not influenced by PP2A-Cdc55. We therefore propose that the PP2A-Cdc55 phosphatase is not involved in cytosolic stress signal perception but is involved in a specific intranuclear mechanism to regulate Msn2 and Msn4 nuclear accumulation and chromatin association under stress conditions.},

abstract = {The high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, composed of membrane-associated osmosensors, adaptor proteins and core signaling kinases, is essential for the survival of yeast cells under hyper-osmotic stress. Here, we studied how the MAPKKK Ste11 might change its protein interaction profile during acute stress exposure, with an emphasis on the sensory system of the so-called Sho1/Msb2 signaling branch. To characterize the transience of protein-protein interactions we utilized a recently described enzymatic in vivo protein proximity assay (M-track). Accordingly, interaction signals between Ste11 and many of its signaling partners can already be detected even under basal conditions. In most cases these signals increase after stress induction. All the interactions are completely dependent on the function of the Ste11-adaptor protein Ste50. Moreover, the presence of either Msb2 or Hkr1 is necessary for observing the interaction between Ste11 and scaffolding factors such as Sho1 and Pbs2. Additional assays suggest that Msb2 is not only in close proximity to Ste11 but might function as an individual Ste11 concentrator at the plasma membrane. Our results confirm the existence of negative feedback systems targeting the protein levels of Ste11 and Msb2 and also hint at changes in the dissociation rates of intermediate signaling complexes.},

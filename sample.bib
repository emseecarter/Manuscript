  abstract = {We have systematically made a set of precisely defined, single-gene
	deletions of all nonessential genes in Escherichia coli K-12. Open-reading
	frame coding regions were replaced with a kanamycin cassette flanked
	by FLP recognition target sites by using a one-step method for inactivation
	of chromosomal genes and primers designed to create in-frame deletions
	upon excision of the resistance cassette. Of 4288 genes targeted,
	mutants were obtained for 3985. To alleviate problems encountered
	in high-throughput studies, two independent mutants were saved for
	every deleted gene. These mutants-the 'Keio collection'-provide a
	new resource not only for systematic analyses of unknown gene functions
	and gene regulatory networks but also for genome-wide testing of
	mutational effects in a common strain background, E. coli K-12 BW25113.
	We were unable to disrupt 303 genes, including 37 of unknown function,
	which are candidates for essential genes. Distribution is being handled

  abstract = {Animal genomes possess highly conserved cis-regulatory sequences that
	are often found near genes that regulate transcription and development.
	Researchers have proposed that the strong conservation of these sequences
	may affect the evolution of the surrounding genome, both by repressing
	rearrangement, and possibly by promoting duplicate gene retention.
	Conflicting data, however, have made the validity of these propositions
	unclear. Here, we use a new computational method to identify phylogenetically
	conserved noncoding elements (PCNEs) in a manner that is not biased
	by rearrangement and duplication. This method is powerful enough
	to identify more than a thousand PCNEs that have been conserved between
	vertebrates and the basal chordate amphioxus. We test 42 of our PCNEs
	in transgenic zebrafish assays-including examples from vertebrates
	and amphioxus-and find that the majority are functional enhancers.
	We find that PCNEs are enriched around genes with ancient synteny
	conservation, and that this association is strongest for extragenic
	PCNEs, suggesting that cis-regulatory interdigitation plays a key
	role in repressing genome rearrangement. Next, we classify mouse
	and zebrafish genes according to association with PCNEs, synteny
	conservation, duplication history, and presence in bidirectional
	promoter pairs, and use these data to cluster gene functions into
	a series of distinct evolutionary patterns. These results demonstrate
	that subfunctionalization of conserved cis-regulation has not been
	the primary determinate of gene duplicate retention in vertebrates.
	Instead, the data support the gene balance hypothesis, which proposes
	that duplicate retention has been driven by selection against dosage
	imbalances in genes with many protein connections.},

	mammal-teleost conserved chromosomal segments to be spanned by highly
	conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs), their developmental regulatory
	target genes, and phylogenetically and functionally unrelated ``bystander''
	genes. Bystander genes are not specifically under the control of
	the regulatory elements that drive the target genes and are expressed
	in patterns that are different from those of the target genes. Reporter
	insertions distal to zebrafish developmental regulatory genes pax6.1/2,

	the expression patterns of these genes even if located inside or
	beyond bystander genes, suggesting that the regulatory domain of
	a developmental regulatory gene can extend into and beyond adjacent
	transcriptional units. We termed these chromosomal segments genomic
	regulatory blocks (GRBs). After whole genome duplication in teleosts,
	GRBs, including HCNEs and target genes, were often maintained in
	both copies, while bystander genes were typically lost from one GRB,
	strongly suggesting that evolutionary pressure acts to keep the single-copy
	GRBs of higher vertebrates intact. We show that loss of bystander
	genes and other mutational events suffered by duplicated GRBs in
	teleost genomes permits target gene identification and HCNE/target
	gene assignment. These findings explain the absence of evolutionary
	breakpoints from large vertebrate chromosomal segments and will aid

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comparative genomics is currently one of the most popular
	approaches to study the regulatory architecture of vertebrate genomes.
	Fish-mammal genomic comparisons have proved powerful in identifying
	conserved non-coding elements likely to be distal cis-regulatory
	modules such as enhancers, silencers or insulators that control the
	expression of genes involved in the regulation of early development.
	The scientific community is showing increasing interest in characterizing
	the function, evolution and language of these sequences. Despite
	this, there remains little in the way of user-friendly access to
	a large dataset of such elements in conjunction with the analysis
	and the visualization tools needed to study them. DESCRIPTION: Here
	we present CONDOR (COnserved Non-coDing Orthologous Regions) available
	at: http://condor.fugu.biology.qmul.ac.uk. In an interactive and
	intuitive way the website displays data on > 6800 non-coding elements
	associated with over 120 early developmental genes and conserved
	across vertebrates. The database regularly incorporates results of
	ongoing in vivo zebrafish enhancer assays of the CNEs carried out
	in-house, which currently number approximately 100. Included and
	highlighted within this set are elements derived from duplication
	events both at the origin of vertebrates and more recently in the
	teleost lineage, thus providing valuable data for studying the divergence
	of regulatory roles between paralogs. CONDOR therefore provides a
	number of tools and facilities to allow scientists to progress in
	their own studies on the function and evolution of developmental
	cis-regulation. CONCLUSION: By providing access to data with an approachable
	graphics interface, the CONDOR database presents a rich resource
	for further studies into the regulation and evolution of genes involved
	in early development.},
